# Creating an API with the ExpressJS library

This project contains the source code of an API built in ExpressJS for a series of video tutorials made for Brazilians developers.

It contains the full source code at the master branch and each video branches to who wants to practice.

## English tutorials

You can find a tutorial for each branch of this project at my medium articles that starts here:

## Branches

Although the branches names are in Portuguese, you will find that all the code are in English.

Each branch defines one lesson and use case, but the *master* branch contains the entire project.

## I just want to use it!

Checklist of what you should have:

- Node installed
- Docker installed
    - run: npm run dev
    - it will start the docker-compose and it will pull a mongo image to serve as your mongo database and it will restart the container each time you will change your code.
    - the API port is: 3000
    
The project itself contains a pre-made scaffold API that is a good starting point to develop an API but its not 100% complete neither is a 100% suggestion of what you should be doing. The idea of this
project is to guide self-students on each point that is important for an API to have, going through 
modularization, common patterns, and a good security level.

Please make sure to remove the hard-coded jwtSecret when you will be using for your own project. You could export as a node variable the values that you want and import it as well.

Have fun ;)
